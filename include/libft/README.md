# Libft

Libft is a custom C library built from scratch that reimplements many standard C library functions and adds additional utilities for string manipulation, memory management, and linked list handling.

This project was developed as part of the 42 curriculum to strengthen understanding of C fundamentals, memory, and data structures.

## Features

- Recreated standard C functions such as:
  - `ft_strlen`, `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_calloc`, etc.
- String manipulation functions:
  - `ft_split`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_substr`, and more.
- Linked list utilities:
  - `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstclear`, `ft_lstmap`, etc.
- Built entirely in C, without using the standard library implementations.

## Compilation

You can build the static library using the included **Makefile**:

```bash
make
